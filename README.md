# Permissions-Helper [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/apl-devs/maven/Permissions-Helper/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/apl-devs/maven/Permissions-Helper/_latestVersion)
A library that generates an activity based on the required permissions for your app. It loads the permissions into a list and will request them upon continuing through the activity flow.

# Compile in your Project
To add to your project, put the following code inside your app module gradle file.

```
repositories {
    maven {
        url  "https://dl.bintray.com/apl-devs/maven"
    }
}

dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.github.apl-devs:perms-helper:1.1'
    ...
}
```

# How to Use
To launch the permissions activity, simply write the following code:

``` java
// Sample set up that explains to the user that you need access to device location.
new PermissionsActivity(getBaseContext())
	// Your app name. You MUST set this, otherwise bad things will happen!
    .withAppName(getResources().getString(R.string.app_name))
    // The permissions you need
    .withPermissions(new Permission(Permissions.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, Permissions.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION))
    // Callback
    .withPermissionFlowCallback(new PermissionsActivity.PermissionFlowCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onPermissionGranted(Permission permission) {
    		// if the permission was granted
            
        }

        @Override
        public void onPermissionDenied(Permission permission) {
            // if the permission was denied
            
        }
    })
    // Set status bar color
    .setStatusBarColor(Color.parseColor("#ffffff"))
    // Set status bar icon color - true = dark icons; false (default) = light icons
    .isStatusBarLight(true)
    // Set background color
    .setBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor("#ffffff"))
    // Set background color behind the buttons
    .setBarColor(Color.parseColor("#ffffff"))
    // Set main text color 
    .setMainTextColor(Color.parseColor("#444444"))
    // Set bar button text color
    .setBarTextColor(Color.parseColor("#444444"))
    // Set navigation bar color
    .setNavBarColor(Color.parseColor("#ffffff"))
    // Change color of icons - it is advised that this be the same color as your text
    .setIconColor(Color.parseColor("#444444"))
    // Launch the permissions activity
    .launch();
```

The color methods are optional, and have defaults already set. The `withAppName()`, `withPermissions()`, `withPermissionsFlowCallback()`, and `launch()` methods are required for the library to work properly. Also, these methods are called only once. You don't need to call `withPermissions()` for each permission you are requesting, but rather pass all of them in one method call. [Refer to the sample app](https://github.com/Andrew-Quebe/Permissions-Helper/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/com/amqtech/permissions/sample/MainActivity.java#L76) to see how this is done.

## Default Explanations
The library comes preloaded with default permission explanations if you wish to use them.

``` java
// Example - you don't need a second parameter for using the default explanations.
new Permission(Permissions.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)
```

# My Inspiration

I was exploring the Android Auto app when I noticed the way they present required permissions to the user. That got me thinking that I could create a library that does exactly that.
